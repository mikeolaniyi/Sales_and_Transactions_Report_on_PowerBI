## Insights and Recommendations:


**1. Geographical Focus:**

Key Insight:  States like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio lead in sales, while Vermont, Delaware, and Rhode Island are underperforming.

Recommendation: The company should focus more marketing and promotional efforts on underperforming states to improve sales, possibly by understanding customer preferences in these regions.

**2. Customer Segmentation:**

Key Insight: The customer segments of Consumer and Corporate consistently drive higher sales compared to the Home Office segment.

Recommendation: Further analysis on Home Office customers may reveal opportunities to better tailor products or services for this group, thereby enhancing sales in that segment.

**3. Transaction Trends:**

Key Insight: Sales volume peaks on weekdays, particularly between Monday and Friday, with fewer transactions on weekends.

Recommendation: Launching special weekend promotions or discounts could help boost sales during these lower-transaction days.

**4. Shipping Preferences:**

Key Insight: There’s a significant preference for Standard Class shipping across most states, with First Class and Same Day options underutilized.

Recommendation: Offering incentives or discounts for faster shipping options could encourage customers to opt for premium shipping services, enhancing customer satisfaction.

**5. Top Product Categories:**

Key Insight: Tables, Chairs, and Technology consistently influence sales increases.

Recommendation: Increase the stock and availability of these high-performing products and consider bundling related products (e.g., chairs with tables) to encourage larger purchases.

These insights suggest that targeted marketing, product promotions, and improving regional strategies could significantly boost sales and improve overall performance.
